# Cyclistic-Case-study
Cyclistic bike-share analysis case study for Google Data Analytics Professional Certification Program.

You are looking at the Cyclistic bike-share marketing analysis project! This is my first case study of Google’s Data Analytics Professional Certificate
program. 
I will perform real-world tasks of a junior data analyst working in the marketing analysis team for a fictional company "Cyclistic", a bike-share company in Chicago. 
The case study requires the analyst to follow the steps of the data analysis process: ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act. 
I will use R through RStudio for processing, analysis and visualization in this case study.

About the company: Cyclistic is a bike-share program launched in 2016. Since then, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of bike stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime. Cyclistic sets itself apart by also offering reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, making bike-share more inclusive to people with disabilities and riders who can’t use a standard two-wheeled bike. The majority of riders opt for traditional bikes; about 8% of riders use the assistive options. Cyclistic users are more likely to ride for leisure, but about 30% use them to commute to work each day.

Until now, Cyclistic’s marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments. One approach that helped make these things possible was the flexibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.
