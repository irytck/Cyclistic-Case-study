# Cyclistic-Case-study
Cyclistic bike-share analysis case study for Google Data Analytics Professional Certification Program.

You are looking at the Cyclistic bike-share marketing analysis project! This is my first case study of Googleâ€™s Data Analytics Professional Certificate
program. 
I will perform real-world tasks of a junior data analyst working in the marketing analysis team for a fictional company "Cyclistic", a bike-share company in Chicago. 
The case study requires the analyst to follow the steps of the data analysis process: ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act. 
I will use R through RStudio for processing, analysis and visualization in this case study.
